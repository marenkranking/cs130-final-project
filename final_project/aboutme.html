            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>My name is Maren Kranking and I'm a second-year at Northwestern University. I'm studying at the Medill School of Journalism while pursuing a minor in Psychology and a certificate in Design. I have a strong interest in graphic design and photography, with most of my experience in print magazine publications. I love the power of visual storytelling, especially the way it can bring a story to life through design.​​​​​​​</p>
            <p>I'm currently the Creative Director for North by Northwestern, NU's award-winning student-run, general interest magazine. Aside from my creative work on campus, I'm a member of Northwestern's women's club volleyball team and Kappa Delta Sorority.</p>
