            <h2><span class="strong">NORTH BY NORTHWESTERN</span><br> MAGAZINE</h2>
            <p class="firstgraph">I joined North by Northwestern, Northwestern's quarterly, student-run general interest magazine, in the winter of my first year. After two quarters as a print designer on staff, I became Creative Director in the fall of my second year and have held the position since.</p>
            <p>As the creative director of NBN, I have a lot of freedom to set the tone of the magazine through typography and color. For me, the most important part about creating a vision for a magazine is achieving cohesion; I create the style guide for each issue to keep things consistent throughout the magazine, despite having nine different designers (and styles!) on our creative team, and set a color scheme that is followed throughout each section. I'm aiming for a sleek, professional-looking magazine, and this is curated through the style guide and emphasis on white space.</p>

            <h3>WINTER & SPRING 2020 ISSUES</h3>
            <p>During these two quarters, I worked as a designer and photographer for North by Northwestern. I learned a lot about the magazine design process, as my high school newsmagazine didn't have a specialized creative team, and began to solidify my style as a designer.</p>
